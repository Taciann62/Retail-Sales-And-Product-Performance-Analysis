# Customer Segmentation Analysis


## Introduction

This data analytics project was completed as part of the Oasis Infobyte internship program (December Batch 2025).
The team provided the data through an open-source data platform, Kaggle. It contains a sales record of an e-commerce store, with key fields such as Age, Product type(fish, meat, gold, fruit, sweet, and wine), Purchasing preference, Income, expenditure, and other relevant information necessary to perform this analysis.

### Project Overview
The e-commerce store collected a well-rounded dataset of its customers to get insight into purchasing behaviour, and perform customer segmentation analysis for an e-
commerce company. By analyzing customer behavior and purchase patterns, the goal is to group customers into distinct segments. This segmentation can inform targeted marketing
strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance overall business strategies.


## My Role
On this project, I assume the role of the data analyst to uncover these insights, provide recommendations that influence decision-making appling K-means to create clusters and segment the customers effectively. As a Junior Data Analyst, this data set and the requirement allowed me to learn K-means, its purpose, and syntax in R, alongside the Elbow method and IQR.

### Data Analytics Objective
- Data Cleaning and Review: Obtained dataset from Kaggle. Explore the dataset, understand its structure, and handle any missing or inconsistent data.
- Descriptive Statistics: Calculate key metrics such as average purchase value, frequency of purchases, etc.
- Customer Segmentation: Utilize clustering algorithms using K-means to segment customers based on behavior and purchase patterns.
- Visualization
- Insights and Recommendations

Business Question:
- Which group was the biggest spender and why?
- What is the most preferred purchasing channel by expenditure and age group?
- What is the total amount spent by each age group and segment?
- How much total was generated by the e-commerce store
- What were the most and least purchased items?
- Overall household income against the total amount spent
- Percentage 
- Website Traffic and Website Purchase vs Category

## Tool
- Google Sheet - Data Preview
- R Studio - Data Analysis
- Tableau - Visualization

## Data Preparation and Observation



## Data Analytics
```R
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(skimr)
library(janitor)
library(tibble)
library(ggplot2)
```
Import Dataset into R and preview
```
head(ifood_df)
```

After the preview, I proceeded to update the column names to make it more understandable and clear for this analysis.
```R
Food_Data<-ifood_df %>% 
  rename(Household_income = Income, 
         Kids= Kidhome, 
         Teen_in_Household = Teenhome,
         Days_AfterPurchase = Recency, 
         Wine_Sales = MntWines, 
         Fruits_Sales = MntFruits, 
         Meat_Sales = MntMeatProducts,
         Fish_Sales = MntFishProducts,
         Sweet_Sales = MntSweetProducts, 
         Gold_Sales= MntGoldProds, 
         Total_Amt= MntTotal, 
         Divorced = marital_Divorced, 
         Single = marital_Single,
         Married = marital_Married, 
         Dating = marital_Together, 
         Widow = marital_Widow,
         Cmp_1 = AcceptedCmp1,
         Cmp_2 = AcceptedCmp2,
         Cmp_3 = AcceptedCmp3,
         Cmp_4 = AcceptedCmp4,
         Cmp_5 = AcceptedCmp5,
         Last_Cmp = Response,
         Cmp_overall = AcceptedCmpOverall,
         Complain = Complain,
         Cust_Age =Age,
         Cust_Days = Customer_Days,
         High_School = `education_2n Cycle`,
         Basic_Edu = education_Basic,
         BSC = education_Graduation,
         MSC = education_Master,
         PHD = education_PhD,
         Discounted_Purchase = NumDealsPurchases, 
         In_Store_Purchase =NumStorePurchases , 
         Web_Purchases = NumWebPurchases, 
         Web_Traffic =NumWebVisitsMonth, 
         Catalogue_Purchases= NumCatalogPurchases,
         Z_Cos = Z_CostContact,
         Z_Rev = Z_Revenue,
         Regular_Prods = MntRegularProds,
  )
```

Then, I proceed to review the data to ensure that the names are properly renamed and no column is missing or unclear. 
```R
str(Food_Data)
```
Ensure the total for the sold items is accurately summed in the Total Amount column(Total_Amt)

```R
Food_Data<-Food_Data %>% 
  mutate(Total_Amt =rowSums(select(., Fish_Sales, Fruits_Sales, Meat_Sales, Wine_Sales, Gold_Sales, Sweet_Sales), na.rm = TRUE))
```

Ensure numeric rows are positive.
```R
Food_Data <- Food_Data %>% 
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), abs))
```
The columns Z_Revenue and Z_Cost were dropped due to uncertainty about what they represented, as the dictionary provided did not define these columns. 
```R
Food_Data<-Food_Data %>% 
  select(-Z_Cos, -Z_Rev)
```

## Remove Duplicates and check for missing values: This reduced the data from 2205 to 2021.
```R
1. Food_Data<-Food_Data %>% 
  distinct() 

2. colSums(is.na(Food_Data))

```
### The household income was reviewed, total, average, and standard deviations the  

```R
Household_Income <- Food_Data %>% 
  summarise(Total_income = sum(Household_income), Avg_income =mean(Household_income), Total_Amt = sum(Total_Amt),
            Avg_total = mean(Total_Amt), Median = median(Total_Amt))
```

| Total Income | Average Income| Total Amount Spent  | Average Amount Spent |
|--------------|---------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Fruit        | 53,283       | 26.365         | 39.78              |
| Gold         | 88,766       | 43.92          | 51.68              |
| Wine         | 61,9421      | 306.49         | 337.60             |
| Meat         | 33,5607      | 166.06         | 219.87             |
| Sweet        | 55,110       | 27.27          | 41.58              |
| Fish         | 75,997       | 37.60          | 54.89              |


## Analysis on each product was conducted as well to understand the sales pattern, most sold, least sold and distribution:
```R
Wine_Sales<- Food_Data %>% 
  summarise(Total_Amt_Spent = sum(Wine_Sales), Avg_Amt_spent = mean(Wine_Sales), Sales_COunt = n(), SD = sd(Wine_Sales), Med = median(Wine_Sales))

Fruit_Sales<- Food_Data %>% 
  summarise(Total_Amt_Spent = sum(Fruits_Sales), Avg_Amt_spent = mean(Fruits_Sales), Sales_COunt = n(), SD = sd(Fruits_Sales), Med = median(Fruits_Sales))

Sweet_Sales <- Food_Data %>% 
  summarise(Total_Amt_Spent = sum(Sweet_Sales), Avg_Amt_spent = mean(Sweet_Sales),Sales_Count =n(), SD = sd(Sweet_Sales), Med = median(Sweet_Sales))

Fish_sales <- Food_Data %>% 
  summarise(Total_Amt_Spent = sum(Fish_Sales), Avg_Amt_spent = mean(Fish_Sales),Sales_Count =n(), SD = sd(Fish_Sales), Med = median(Fish_Sales))

Gold_Sales <- Food_Data %>% 
  summarise(Total_Amt_Spent = sum(Gold_Sales), Avg_Amt_spent = mean(Gold_Sales),Sales_Count =n(), SD = sd(Gold_Sales), Med = median(Gold_Sales))

Meat_Sales <- Food_Data %>% 
  summarise(Total_Amt_Spent = sum(Meat_Sales), Avg_Amt_spent = mean(Meat_Sales),Sales_Count =n(), SD = sd(Meat_Sales), Med = median(Meat_Sales))
```

Result: 
| Product Type | Total Amount | Average Amount | Standard Deviation |
|--------------|--------------|----------------|--------------------|
| Fruit        | 53,283       | 26.365         | 39.78              |
| Gold         | 88,766       | 43.92          | 51.68              |
| Wine         | 61,9421      | 306.49         | 337.60             |
| Meat         | 33,5607      | 166.06         | 219.87             |
| Sweet        | 55,110       | 27.27          | 41.58              |
| Fish         | 75,997       | 37.60          | 54.89              |
### Understanding K-Means and application.

K-means, in basic terms, is a process that enables analysts to segment data into groups of clusters based on specific similarities that are crucial.
