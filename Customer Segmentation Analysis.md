# Customer Segmentation Analysis


## Introduction

This data analytics project was completed as part of the Oasis Infobyte internship program (December Batch 2025).
The team provided the data through an open-source data platform, Kaggle. It contains a sales record of an e-commerce store, with key fields such as Age, Product type(fish, meat, gold, fruit, sweet, and wine), Purchasing preference, Income, expenditure, and other relevant information necessary to perform this analysis.

### Project Overview
The e-commerce store collected a well-rounded dataset of its customers to get insight into purchasing behaviour, and perform customer segmentation analysis for an e-
commerce company. By analyzing customer behavior and purchase patterns, the goal is to group customers into distinct segments. This segmentation can inform targeted marketing
strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance overall business strategies.


## My Role
On this project, I assume the role of the data analyst to uncover these insights, provide recommendations that influence decision-making.
